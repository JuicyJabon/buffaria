Huge thanks to the youtuber Obsoleek, he is the first to showcase the Buffaria mod on his discord server! Make sure you are subscribed to him, he is a great person!
For a short period of time, his channel will be the homepage for this mod, to show my thanks!

Buffaria is a mod all about potions! The main reason for this mod to exist is to add more variety and combinations of the current vanilla potions. Current additions include phials, which are like flasks for melee weapons, but can be applied to all weapons. Other things are a secret!

*NOTICE*
I have kept the source code and sprites open source, because I want to help people create their own mods. Please do not blatantly copy my code and sprites, I have spent many hours working on them. I just want to be of help to those who are less experienced with creating mods.

Credits are at the bottom!

v2.2.4.2

Adde Hand Sanitizer

v2.2.3.2
Added Potion Fuser which saves ingredients occasionally
(The Potion Fuser is a combination of the Potion Mixer and the Alchemy Station)

u/Uniquepotatoes - Texture inspiration. The textures are similar but not copies. This is because I really loved their textures, and wanted to have a similar style to them! (Reddit)
