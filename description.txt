Buffaria is a mod all about potions! The main reason for this mod to exist is to add more variety and combinations of the current vanilla potions. Current additions other than potions include phials, which are like flasks for melee weapons, but can be applied to all weapons.
Credits are at the bottom!

Here is the mod's Discord Server, where you can add suggestions for potions, or even help with some sprites! https://discord.gg/g3kEcWy

Credit to u/Uniquepotatoes for the texture ispiration. The textures are similar but not copies. This is because I really loved their textures, and wanted to have a similar style to them! (luckily I was able to find their post on reddit in r/Terraria)
